How to use JSDOC
================

###### Written by Peter van der Velde

For this we need the following:
- a computer
- NodeJS installed
- and also NPM (which comes with node)

Go to your project directory and open it in your terminal and type:
```bash
npm install
```
Which installs jsdoc in your local project.

To generate the documentation files run:
```
npm run doc
```
After that browse to the $PROJECTFOLDER/doc/jsdoc.

For more information on how to write the documentation see already existing comments and the followong websites:
